# FhirForm

Fhirform helps convert fhir questionnaires into a json-schema representation that can then be rendered as a form. Its heavily inspired by the [lforms](github.com/lhncbc/lforms) library

Features include:

    - Form definitions are defined in an a flavour of json schema, listing the questions
    - Sections containing questions
    - Repeating sections and questions (by specifying cardinality)
    - Date fields
    - Help messages for questions
    - Support for HL7 FHIR Questionnaires

The code is divided into 2 sections:

1. core - a set of classes that holds utilities to convert questionnaires into a json-schema. It also includes utility classes that merge formdata and the schema into a fhir questionnaire response. Core is fully ui framework agnostic and thus can be used in any application with the framework oof your choice
2. Form rendering - React-based widget that takes the json-schema generated by core and transform that into a form. it uses uniforms-antd for fields autogeneration while allowing for a robust mechanism where you can define new display control components for esoteric needs.

Fhirform is still in active development and thus still missing key features when it comes to json-schema conversion. The code is also not quite up to standard but we are continously working to make it better.
